## Drop Shadow
Script for showing simple drop shadows for furniture without killing the performance on phone. 
### Use
Just add it as child of a sprite you want to create shadow for. For it to work you have add light sources to "light_sources" group

## Random Sprite
Script to attach to furniture to give them random appearance and rotation. Good for placing stuff to make them look more natural
### Use
Add to object you want to randomize. Select on the UI if you want random rotation and how many variations you have of the sprite. Add the sprites to the script in UI you want to use. You only have to add the amount of sprites you have selected. Maximum variations is 3 but it should be easy to increase that.
